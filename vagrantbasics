Vagrant is an application used to manage virtual machines. Vagrant provides a public catalog of operating system images for registered users and organizations.

Definitions:
  * Box - a box is an operating system image
  * Project - Folder Containing a Vagrantfile
  * Vagrantfile - 
  
Commands:
  * vagrant add USER/BOX
    USER = vagrant cloud user ID / BOX = vagrant user defined box
    (vagrant add klblake/centos7)
    
    mkdir vm1 - creates a directory called vm1
    cd vm1 - change directory to vm1
    vagrant init USER/BOX
    vagrant up - imports and starts the project in VirtualBox
      if USER/BOX exists, vagrant will start the machine
     vagrant ssh [VM_Name]
     vagrant halt [VM_Name]
     vagrant up [VM_Name]
     vagrant suspend [VM]
     vagrant resume [VM]
     vagrant destroy [VM]
     vagrant - lists options
   
      
By default vagrant will run the box instance in headless mode
The Vagrant init file can contain definitions for a multi-machine setup. (Insight - Super awesome for creating and maintaining multiple environments such as Development, UAT and Production setups)
